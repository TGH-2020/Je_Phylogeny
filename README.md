# A phylogenetic classification of the Je language family

This is the repository accompanying the study by Ferraz Gerardi et al. (2025) [[1]](#1).
The [trees](/trees/) folder contains the settings and the output of all tree runs conducted.  
The [data](/data/) folder contains:
* a list of all concepts that have been used in the study, along with the coverage and the number of cognate sets per concept ([concepts.csv](/data/concepts.csv))
* a list of all word forms and corresponding cogids assigned by automated cognacy judgements and used in the study ([auto_cogids.tsv](/data/auto_cogids.tsv))
* a subset of the data with columns for automatically and manually annotated cognates (used to assess the quality of automatic annotations; [subset_for_metrics_calculation.csv](/data/subset_for_metrics_calculation.csv))
